# IPL Victory Probability Estimator  
A machine learning-based project to estimate the probability of victory in an IPL match. This tool uses historical data and provides real-time predictions through a user-friendly Streamlit app, making cricket match analysis simple and interactive.

## **Features**  
- Predict the probability of victory for an IPL team based on match conditions.  
- Input parameters include:  
  - Batting team  
  - Bowling team  
  - Host city  
  - Target score  
  - Current score  
  - Overs done  
  - Wickets fallen  
- Interactive and visually appealing results displayed in a Streamlit app.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, model development, and analysis.  
- **JupyterLab**: For exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.  
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
